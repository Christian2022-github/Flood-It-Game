# Maze Generator

The goal for this  project is to create a Maze generator using Kruskal's algorithm to develop different spanning trees to generate an infinite number of random mazes, with implementing both BFS and DFS algorithms to find the most efficient way to solve the maze

# How It's Made!
Java, IntelliJ

# Key Functions
"R" - Restart the maze and gives a random maze (seed <br>
"B" - Finds the fastest way using BFS<br>
"D" - Finds the fastest way using DFS<br>
